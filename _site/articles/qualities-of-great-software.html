  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I ended the second volume of Practicing Ruby by launching an exploration into the uncomfortable question of what it means to write good code. To investigate the topic, I began to compile a wiki full of small case studies for each of the different properties outlined by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_9126">ISO/IEC 9126</a> – an international standard for evaluating software quality. While I made good headway on this project before taking a break for the holidays, I left some of it unfinished and promised to kick off this new volume by presenting my completed work.</p>

<p>While it is possible to read through the wiki by <a href="https://github.com/elm-city-craftworks/code_quality/wiki">starting at the overview on the homepage</a> and then clicking through it page by page, there is a tremendous amount of content there on lots of disjoint topics. To help find your way through these materials, I’ve summarized their contents below so that you know what to expect.</p>

<h3 id="functionality-concerns">Functionality concerns</h3>

<p>While we all know that getting our software to work correctly is important, the functional qualities of our software are often not emphasized as much as they should be. Issues to consider in this area include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/elm-city-craftworks/code_quality/wiki/Suitability">suitability</a> of our software for serving its intended purpose. As an example, I note the differences between the <em>open-uri</em> vs. <em>net/http</em> standard libraries and suggest that while they have some overlap in functionality, they are aimed at very different use cases.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/elm-city-craftworks/code_quality/wiki/Accuracy">accuracy</a> of our software in meeting its requirements. As an example, I discuss how a small bug in Gruff made the entire library unusable for running a particular report, even though it otherwise was well suited for the problem.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/elm-city-craftworks/code_quality/wiki/Interoperability">interoperability</a> of our software and how it effects our ability to fit seamlessly into the user’s environment. As an example, I discuss at a high level the benefits of using the Rack webserver interface as compared to writing adapters that directly connect web frameworks with web servers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/elm-city-craftworks/code_quality/wiki/Security">security</a> of our software and how it affects the safety of our users and the systems our software runs on. As an example, I discuss a small twitter bot I wrote for demonstration purposes that had a operating system command injection vulnerability, and also show how I fixed the problem.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="reliability-concerns">Reliability concerns</h3>

<p>Even if our software does what it is supposed to do, if it does not do so reliably, it will not do a good job at making users happy. Issues to consider in this area include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/elm-city-craftworks/code_quality/wiki/Maturity">maturity</a> of our software, i.e. the gradual reduction of unexpected defects over time. As an example, I discuss some regression tests we’ve written for the Practicing Ruby web application.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/elm-city-craftworks/code_quality/wiki/Fault-Tolerance">fault tolerance</a> of our software, i.e. how easy it is for us to mitigate the impact of failures in our code. As an example, I discuss at a high level about how ActiveRecord implements error handling around failed validations, and show a pure Ruby approximation for how to build something similar.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/elm-city-craftworks/code_quality/wiki/Recoverability">recoverability</a> of our software when dealing with certain kinds of failures. As an example, I discuss various features that resque-retry provide for trying to recover from background job failures.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="usability-concerns">Usability concerns</h3>

<p>Once we have code that does it’s job correctly and does it well, we still need to think about how pleasant of an experience we create for our users. Issue to consider in this area include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/elm-city-craftworks/code_quality/wiki/Understandability">understandability</a> of our software, in particular how well its functionality is organized and how well documented it is. As an example, I extract some guidelines for writing a good README file using Sinatra’s README as a reference.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/elm-city-craftworks/code_quality/wiki/Learnability">learnability</a> of our software, i.e. how easy it is to discover new ways of using the software based on what the user already knows. As an example, I discuss a change we made to the Prawn graphics API to make things more consistent and easier to learn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/elm-city-craftworks/code_quality/wiki/Operability">operability</a> of our software, particularly whether we give our users the control and flexibility they need to get their job done. As an example, I discuss how most Markdown processors in Ruby function as black boxes, and how RedCarpet 2 takes a different approach that makes it much easier to customize.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/elm-city-craftworks/code_quality/wiki/Attractiveness">attractiveness</a> of our software. As an example, I show the difference between low level and high level interfaces for interacting with the Cairo graphics library, and illustrate how the use of syntactic sugar can influence user behavior.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="efficiency-concerns">Efficiency concerns</h3>

<p>Ruby has had a reputation for being a slow, resource intensive programming language. As a result, we need to rely on some special tricks to make sure that our code is fast enough to meet the needs of our users. Issues to consider in this area include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/elm-city-craftworks/code_quality/wiki/Performance">performance</a> of our software. As an example, I talk at a very high level about the computationally expensive nature of PNG alpha channel splitting, and how C extensions can be used to solve that problem.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/elm-city-craftworks/code_quality/wiki/Resource-Utilization">resource utilization</a> characteristics of our software. While this most frequently means memory and disk space usage, there are lots of different resources our programs use. As an example, I talk about the fairly elegant use of file locking in the PStore standard library.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="maintainability-concerns">Maintainability concerns</h3>

<p>No matter how good our software is, it will ultimately be judged by how well it can change and grow over time. This is the area we tend to spend most of our time studying, because difficult to maintain projects make us miserable as programmers. Issues to consider in this area include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/elm-city-craftworks/code_quality/wiki/Analyzability">analyzability</a> of our software, i.e. how easy it is for us to reason about our code. As an example, I discuss at a high level how the Flog utility assigns scores to methods based on their complexity, and how that can be used to identify areas of your code that need refactoring.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/elm-city-craftworks/code_quality/wiki/Changeability">changeability</a> of our software, which is commonly considered the holy grail of software design. As an example, I point out connascence as a mental model for reasoning about the relationships between software components and how easy or hard they are to change.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/elm-city-craftworks/code_quality/wiki/Stability">stability</a> of our software, in particular how much impact changes have on users. As an example, I talk about the merits of designing unobtrusive APIs for reducing the amount of moving parts in our code.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/elm-city-craftworks/code_quality/wiki/Testability">testability</a> of our software. As an example, I discuss how useful the SOLID principles are in making our code easier to test.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="portability-concerns">Portability concerns</h3>

<p>One thing we don’t think about often in Ruby, perhaps not often enough, is how easy it is for folks to get our software up and running in environments other than our own. While writing code in a high level language does get us away from some of the problems that system programmers need to consider, there are still platform and environment issues that deserve our attention. Issues to consider in this area include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/elm-city-craftworks/code_quality/wiki/Adaptability">adaptability</a> of our software to the user’s environment. As an example, I discuss at a high level the approach HighLine takes to shield the user from having to write low level console interaction code.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/elm-city-craftworks/code_quality/wiki/Installability">installability</a> of our software. As an example, I discuss some general thoughts about the state of installing Ruby software, and look into an interesting approach to setting up a Rails application in Jordan Byron’s Mission of Mercy clinic management project.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/elm-city-craftworks/code_quality/wiki/Co-existence">co-existence</a> of our software with other software in the user’s environment. As an example, I discuss how conflicting monkey patches led me on a wild goose chase in one of my Rails applications.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/elm-city-craftworks/code_quality/wiki/Replaceability">replaceability</a> of our software as well as the ability for our software to act as a drop in replacement for other tools. Because I feel this concept is one baked into the UNIX and open source culture, I don’t provide a specific case study but instead point out several applications of this idea in the wild.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="reflections">Reflections</h3>

<p>Spending several weeks studying this topic just so I can <em>start</em> a discussion with our readers has been a painful, but enlightening experience for me. As you can see from the giant laundry list of concerns listed above, the concept of software quality is much deeper than something like <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?XpSimplicityRules">The Four Simple Rules of Design</a> might imply.</p>

<p>It is no surprise that we yearn for something more simple than what I’ve outlined here, but I cannot in good conscience remove any of the focus areas outlined by ISO/IEC 9126 as being unimportant when it comes to software quality. While we cannot expect that all of our software will be shining examples of all of these properties all of the time, we do have a responsibility for knowing how to spot the tensions between these various concerns and we must do our best to resolve them in a smart way.</p>

<p>While our intuition and experience may allow us to address most of the issues I’ve outlined here at a subconscious level, I feel that more work needs to be done for us to seriously consider ourselves good engineers. The real challenge for me personally is to figure out how to continue to study these topics without stifling my creativity, willingness to experiment, and ability to make decisions without becoming overwhelmed.</p>

<p>I look forward to hearing your own thoughts on this topic, because it is one that we probably need to work through together if we want to make any real progress.</p>
