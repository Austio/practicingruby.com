<p>Like many of you, I discovered Ruby via Rails and web development. That was my
“in.” But before it was popular for writing web apps, Ruby was known for its
object-oriented fundamentals and for being a great scripting language. One of the reasons for
this latter benefit is that it’s so easy to marry Ruby with command-line
utilities. Here’s an example:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">task</span> <span class="ss">:console</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="sb">`irb -r my_app`</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>There’s something simple and beautiful in the combination of Ruby and the
command line here–the backticks are barely detectable. This code will technically 
accomplish what you think it will: it will drop you into an app-specific console  that is
basically an <code class="highlighter-rouge">irb</code> session with your app already required. But do you know what’s 
going on inside that backtick method?</p>

<p>Ruby provides many ways of spawing processes. Why use backticks instead of
<code class="highlighter-rouge">system</code>?</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">task</span> <span class="ss">:console</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="nb">system</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'irb -r my_app'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Or what about <code class="highlighter-rouge">exec</code>? Would that have been better?</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">task</span> <span class="ss">:console</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="nb">exec</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'irb'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'-r'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'my_app'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>In order to make this decision, you need to understand what these methods are
doing under the hood. The differences may be trivial for spawning a development
console, but picking one of these methods over another in a production environment can
have major implications.</p>

<p>In this article, we’re going to reimplement the key parts of these process-spawning
primitives to get a better understanding of how they work and where they’re most
applicable. Afterward, you’ll have a greater understanding of how process
spawning works regardless of programming language and you’ll have a grip on
which methods are most applicable in different situations.</p>

<h2 id="starting-somewhere">Starting somewhere</h2>

<p>I have already hinted at a few different process-spawning methods–Ruby has
a ton of them. Off the top of my head, there’s: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Kernel#system</code>,
<code>Kernel#\`</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">IO.popen</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Process.spawn</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">open</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">shell</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">open3</code>,
<code class="highlighter-rouge">pty</code>, and probably more. All of these ship with Ruby, some in the core and
others in the standard library.</p>

<p>All of these spawning methods boil down to the same pattern, but we’re not going
to implement them all. To save time, we’ll stick with implementing <code class="highlighter-rouge">system</code> and
the backtick method. Either of these methods can be called
with a shell command as the argument. Both handle the command in slightly
different ways with slightly different outputs:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>system('ls -l') #=&gt; true
system('ls -l *.rb | ack Product') #=&gt; true
system('boohoo') #=&gt; nil
`git log -n1 --format=%h^` #=&gt; 51e7a1c
`hostname` #=&gt; jessebook
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Let’s start building them.</p>

<h2 id="harnessing-ourselves-with-tests">Harnessing ourselves with tests</h2>

<p>Before we dive into spawning process head first, let’s rein ourselves in a
bit. If we’re going to reimplement what Ruby already provides, we’re going to
need a way to test our implementation and make sure that it performs the same
way that Ruby does. Enter <a href="http://rubyspec.org">Rubyspec</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The RubySpec project aims to write a complete executable specification for the
Ruby programming language that is syntax-compatible with RSpec. RSpec is
essentially a DSL (domain-specific language) for describing the behavior of
code. This project contains specs that describe Ruby language syntax, core
library classes, and standard library classes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>RubySpec provides a specification for the Ruby language itself, and we want to
reimplement a part of the Ruby language; therefore, we can use RubySpec
to test our implementation.</p>

<p>To use these specs to drive our implementation, we need to get two
things: RubySpec itself, and its testing library mspec. You can check
out <a href="https://github.com/rubyspec/rubyspec/blob/master/README">this README</a> 
for installation instructions. To verify that things are working as 
expected, try running the kernel tests from within the RubySpec project
directory:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>mspec core/kernel
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>To run our custom code against these tests, we can use
the familiar <code class="highlighter-rouge">-r</code> option with <code class="highlighter-rouge">mspec</code> to require a file that redefines
the methods we want to override. Let’s do that, while at the same time 
running the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Kernel.system</code> specs:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>touch practicing_spawning.rb
<span class="gp">$ </span>mspec -r ./practicing_spawning.rb core/kernel/system_spec.rb
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Should be all green so far!</p>

<h2 id="breaking-the-test">Breaking the test</h2>

<p>Let’s begin our implementation by causing the tests to fail:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># practicing_spawning.rb</span>
<span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">Kernel</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">system</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">args</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="kp">private</span> <span class="ss">:system</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The very first spec says that <code class="highlighter-rouge">system</code> should be private. I set that up right
away because it’s not the interesting part. If we run the <code class="highlighter-rouge">system</code> specs again,
we get our first of several failures:</p>

<div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>1)
Kernel#system executes the specified command in a subprocess FAILED
Expected (STDOUT): "a\n"
          but got: ""
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This failure directly relates to the following spec:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">it</span> <span class="s2">"executes the specified command in a subprocess"</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="nb">lambda</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="vi">@object</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">system</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"echo a"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">}.</span><span class="nf">should</span> <span class="n">output_to_fd</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"a</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If you’ve ever used the <code class="highlighter-rouge">system</code> method, this test should be easy to
understand. It says that shelling out to <code class="highlighter-rouge">echo</code> should output the echoed string.
If you <a href="https://github.com/rubyspec/mspec/blob/master/lib/mspec/matchers/output_to_fd.rb#L68-70">dig into</a>
 the <code class="highlighter-rouge">output_to_fd</code> method that’s part of <code class="highlighter-rouge">mspec</code>, you’ll see that it’s
expecting this output on <code class="highlighter-rouge">STDOUT</code>.</p>

<h2 id="fork-and-subprocesses">fork and subprocesses</h2>

<p>The failing spec title says that <code class="highlighter-rouge">system</code> spawns a subprocess. If you’re
creating new processes on a Unix system, that means using <code class="highlighter-rouge">fork</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <hr />
  <p>Kernel.fork  [{ block }]   -&gt; fixnum or nil<br />
  Process.fork [{ block }]   -&gt; fixnum or nil</p>

  <hr />

  <p>Creates a subprocess. If a block is specified, that block is run in the
subprocess, and the subprocess terminates with a status of zero. Otherwise,
the fork call returns twice, once in the parent, returning the process ID of
the child, and once in the child, returning nil.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This bit of Ruby documentation gives you an idea of what <code class="highlighter-rouge">fork</code> does. It’s
conceptually similar to going on a hike and coming to a fork in the trail. The
trail represents the execution of a process over time. Whereas humans can only
pick one path, when a process is forked it literally continues down both
branches of the trail in parallel. What was one process becomes two independent 
processes. This behavior is specified by the fork(2) manpage:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fork() causes creation of a new process.  The new process (child process) is
an exact copy of the calling process (parent process) […]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you <code class="highlighter-rouge">fork</code>, you start with one process and end up with two processes that
are <em>exactly the same</em>. In some cases, this means that everything is copied from
one process to the other. But if <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write">copy-on-write
semantics</a> are implemented,
the two processes may physically share memory until one of them tries to
modify it; then each gets its own copy written out.</p>

<p>Although understanding <code class="highlighter-rouge">fork</code> is certainly helpful, we still haven’t quite figured
out how to implement the <code class="highlighter-rouge">system</code> method. We know that we can take our Ruby 
process and create a copy of it with <code class="highlighter-rouge">fork</code>, but how do we then turn the 
new child process into an <code class="highlighter-rouge">echo</code> process?</p>

<h2 id="fork--exec">fork + exec</h2>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">fork</code> + <code class="highlighter-rouge">exec</code> pattern for spawning processes is the blueprint upon which
most process spawning is built. We’ve already looked at <code class="highlighter-rouge">fork</code>, so what
about <code class="highlighter-rouge">exec</code>?</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">exec</code> transforms the current process into another process. Using
<code class="highlighter-rouge">exec</code>, you can transform a Ruby process into an <code class="highlighter-rouge">ls</code> process, another Ruby
process, or an <code class="highlighter-rouge">echo</code> process:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s1">'hi from Ruby'</span>
<span class="nb">exec</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'ls'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s1">'bye from Ruby'</span> <span class="c1"># will never be reached</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This program will never get to the last line of Ruby code. Once it has performed
<code class="highlighter-rouge">exec('ls')</code>, the Ruby program no longer exists. It has been transformed to <code class="highlighter-rouge">ls</code>.
So there’s no possible way for it to get back to this Ruby program and finish
execution.</p>

<h2 id="finally-a-passing-test">Finally, a passing test</h2>

<p>With <code class="highlighter-rouge">fork</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">exec</code>, we now have the building blocks that we need to implement
our own <code class="highlighter-rouge">system</code> method. Here’s the most basic implementation:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># practicing_spawning.rb</span>
<span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">Kernel</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">system</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">args</span><span class="p">)</span>

    <span class="c1"># Create a new subprocess that will just exec the requested program.</span>
    <span class="n">pid</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">fork</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="nb">exec</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">args</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="c1"># Because fork() allows both processes to work in parallel, we must tell the</span>
    <span class="c1"># parent process to wait for the child to exit. Otherwise, the parent would</span>
    <span class="c1"># continue in parallel with the child and would be unable to process its</span>
    <span class="c1"># return value.</span>
    <span class="n">_</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">status</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Process</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">waitpid2</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">pid</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">status</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">success?</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="kp">private</span> <span class="ss">:system</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If we run this against the same spec as before, more tests pass, but
not all of them. Still, getting that initial spec to pass means that we’re headed
in the right direction.</p>

<p>There are three very simple Unix programming primitives in use here: <code class="highlighter-rouge">fork</code>,
<code class="highlighter-rouge">exec</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">wait</code>. We’ve already talked about <code class="highlighter-rouge">fork</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">exec</code>, the
cornerstone of Unix process spawning. The third player here, <code class="highlighter-rouge">wait</code>, is often
used in unison with these two. It tells the parent process to wait for the child
process before continuing, rather than continuing execution in parallel. This is
a pretty common pattern when spawning shell commands, because you usually want to
wait for the output of the command.</p>

<p>In this case, we collect the status of the child when it exits and return the
result of <code class="highlighter-rouge">success?</code>. This result is <code class="highlighter-rouge">true</code> for a successful exit status code (i.e., 0)
and <code class="highlighter-rouge">false</code> for any other value.</p>

<h2 id="getting-back-to-green">Getting back to green</h2>

<p>Now we need to get the rest of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">system</code> specs passing. In
the remainder of the failures, we see the following output:</p>

<div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>1) 
Kernel#system returns nil when command execution fails FAILED
Expected false to be nil
&lt;snipped backtrace...&gt;

2)
Kernel#system does not write to stderr when command execution fails FAILED
Expected (STDERR): ""
         but got: "/[...]/practicing_spawning.rb:8:in `exec': No such 
         file or directory - sad (Errno::ENOENT)
&lt;snipped backtrace...&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>These failures relate to the following specs:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ruby_version_is</span> <span class="s2">"1.9"</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="n">it</span> <span class="s2">"returns nil when command execution fails"</span> <span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="vi">@object</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">system</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"sad"</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">should</span> <span class="n">be_nil</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="n">it</span> <span class="s2">"does not write to stderr when command execution fails"</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="nb">lambda</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="vi">@object</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">system</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"sad"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">}.</span><span class="nf">should</span> <span class="n">output_to_fd</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">""</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">STDERR</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Both of these specs are testing the same situation: trying to <code class="highlighter-rouge">exec</code> a command
that doesn’t exist. When this happens, it actually raises an exception in
the subprocess, as is evidenced by the previously listed failure #2, which prints an
exception message along with a stacktrace on its <code class="highlighter-rouge">STDERR</code>, whereas the spec
expected that <code class="highlighter-rouge">STDERR</code> would be empty.</p>

<p>So when the subprocess raises an exception, we need to notify the parent process
of what went wrong. Note that we can’t use Ruby’s regular exception handling in
this case because the exception is happening inside the subprocess. The
subprocess got a copy of everything that the parent had, including the Ruby
interpreter. So although all of the code is sourced from the same file, we can’t
depend on regular Ruby features because the processes are actually running on
their own separate copies of the Ruby interpreter!</p>

<p>To solve this problem, we need some form of interprocess communication (IPC).
Keeping with the general theme of this article, we’ll use a Unix pipe.</p>

<h2 id="the-pipe">The pipe</h2>

<p>A call to <code class="highlighter-rouge">IO.pipe</code> in Ruby will return two <code class="highlighter-rouge">IO</code> objects, one readable and
one writable. Together, they form a one-way data ‘pipe’. Data is written
to one <code class="highlighter-rouge">IO</code> object and read from the other:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">rd</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">wr</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">IO</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">pipe</span>
<span class="n">wr</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">write</span> <span class="s2">"ping"</span>
<span class="n">wr</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">close</span>

<span class="n">rd</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">read</span> <span class="c1">#=&gt; "ping"</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>A pipe can be used for IPC by taking advantage of <code class="highlighter-rouge">fork</code> semantics. If you
create a pipe before forking, the child process inherits a copy of the pipe
from its parent. As both have a copy, one process can write to the pipe while
the other reads from it, enabling IPC. Pipes are
backed by the kernel itself, so we can use them to communicate between our independent
Ruby processes.</p>

<h2 id="implementing-system-with-a-pipe">Implementing system() with a pipe</h2>

<p>Now we can roll together all of these concepts and write our own implementation
of <code class="highlighter-rouge">system</code> that passes all the specs:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># practicing_spawning.rb</span>

        <span class="nb">exit</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
      <span class="k">end</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>

    <span class="c1"># The parent process closes its copy of the writing end of the pipe</span>

<h2 id="implementing-backticks">Implementing backticks</h2>

<p>Now that you’ve got the fundamentals under your belt, we can apply these concepts to the
implementation of other process-spawning methods. Let’s do backticks:</p>

<p>Now we can run the backticks spec against our implementation and see that it’s
all green!</p>

<h2 id="closing-notes">Closing notes</h2>

<p>I find something special in spawning processes. You get to dig down
below the top layer of your programming language to the lower layer where All
Things Are One. When dealing with things such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">fork</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">exec</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">wait</code>, your
operating system treats all processes equally. Any Ruby process can transform
into a C program, or a Python process, or vice versa. Similarly, you can <code class="highlighter-rouge">wait</code>
on processes written in any language. At this layer of abstraction, there are only
the system and its primitives.</p>

<p>We spend a lot of our mental energy worrying about good principles such as
abstraction, decoupling, efficiency. When digging down a layer and learning what
your operating system is capable of, you see an extremely robust and abstract
system. It cares not how you implement your programs but offers the same
functionality for any running program. Understanding your system at this level
will really show you what it’s capable of and give you a good mental
understanding of how your system sees the world. Once you really grasp the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">fork</code> + <code class="highlighter-rouge">exec</code> concepts, you’ll see that these are right at the core of a Unix system.
Every process is spawned this way. The simplest example is your shell, which uses
this very pattern to launch programs.</p>

<p>I’ll leave you with two more tips:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Use <code class="highlighter-rouge">exec()</code> at the end of scripts to save a process. Remember the early example
in which a rake task spawned an <code class="highlighter-rouge">irb</code> session? The obvious
choice in that case is to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">exec</code>.</p>

    <p>Any other variant will require forking a new process that then execs and
 has the parent wait for it. Using <code class="highlighter-rouge">exec</code> directly eliminates the need for an extra
 process by transforming the <code class="highlighter-rouge">rake</code> process directly into an <code class="highlighter-rouge">irb</code> process.
 This trick obviously won’t work in situations where you need to shell out and then
 work with the output, but keep it in mind if the last line of your script
 just shells out.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pass an <code class="highlighter-rouge">Array</code> instead of a <code class="highlighter-rouge">String</code>. The backticks method always takes a
string, but the <code class="highlighter-rouge">system</code> method (and many other process spawning methods) will
take an array or a string.</p>

    <p>When passed a string, <code class="highlighter-rouge">exec</code> may spawn a shell to interpret the
 command, rather than executing it directly. This approach is handy for stuff like
 <code class="highlighter-rouge">system('find . | ack foobar -l')</code> but is very dangerous when user input is
 involved. An unescaped string makes shell injection possible. Shell
 injection is like SQL injection, except that a compromised shell could provide an
 attacker with root access to your entire system! Using an array will never
 spawn a shell but will pass the elements directly as the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ARGV</code> of the exec’ed process. 
 Always do this.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Finally, if you enjoyed these exercises, try to implement some of
the other process spawning primitives I mentioned. With RubySpec as your guide,
you can try reimplementing just about anything with confidence. Doing so will
surely give you a better understanding of how process spawning works in Ruby–or 
any Unix environment.</p>

<p>Please leave a comment and share your code if you implement some pure-Ruby versions 
of these spawning methods. I’d love to see them!</p>
