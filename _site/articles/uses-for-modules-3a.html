<p>In the <a href="http://practicingruby.com/articles/38">last issue</a>, we discussed the use of <code class="highlighter-rouge">extend self</code> in great detail, but neglected to cover a pair of alternatives that seem on the surface to be functionally equivalent. While I don’t want to spend too much time rehashing an old topic, I want to at least provide an example of each approach and comment on their quirks.</p>

<h3 id="defining-methods-at-the-module-level">Defining methods at the module level</h3>

<p>Occasionally folks ask whether mixing a module into itself via <code class="highlighter-rouge">extend()</code> is equivalent to the code shown below.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">Greeter</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nc">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">hello</span>
    <span class="s2">"hi"</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The short answer to that question is “no”, but it is easy to see where the confusion comes from, because calling <code class="highlighter-rouge">Greeter.hello</code> does indeed work as expected. But the important distinction is that methods defined in this way are simply directly defined on the module itself and so cannot be mixed into anything at all. There is really very little difference between the above code and the example below.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">obj</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Object</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nc">obj</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">hello</span>
  <span class="s2">"hi"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Consider our earlier example of Ruby’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">Math</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">FileUtils</code> modules. With both of these modules, you can envision scenarios in which you would call the functions on the modules themselves. But there are also cases where using these modules as mixins would make a lot of sense. For example, Ruby itself ships with a math mode (-m) for irb which mixes in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Math</code> module at the top level so you can call its functions directly.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">irb</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">m</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">sin</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">Math</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">PI</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">0</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>In the above example, if <code class="highlighter-rouge">sin()</code> were implemented by defining the method
directly on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Math</code> module, there would be no way to mix it into anything.
While sometimes it might make sense to force a module to never be used as a
mixin, that use case is rare, and so little is gained by defining methods on
modules rather than using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">extend self</code> technique.</p>

<h3 id="using-modulefunction">Using <code class="highlighter-rouge">module_function</code></h3>

<p>Before people got in the habit of mixing modules into themselves, they often relied on a more specialized feature called <code class="highlighter-rouge">module_function</code> to accomplish the same goals.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">Greeter</span>
  <span class="kp">module_function</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">hello</span>
    <span class="s2">"hi"</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This code allows the direct calling of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Greeter.hello</code>, and does not prevent
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Greeter</code> from being mixed into other objects. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">module_function</code> approach
also allows you to choose certain methods to be module functions while 
leaving others accessible via mixin only:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">Greeter</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">hello</span>
    <span class="s2">"hi"</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">goodbye</span>
    <span class="s2">"bye"</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="kp">module_function</span> <span class="ss">:hello</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>With this modified definition, it is still possible to call <code class="highlighter-rouge">Greeter.hello</code>, but attempting to call <code class="highlighter-rouge">Greeter.goodbye</code> would raise a <code class="highlighter-rouge">NoMethodError</code>. This sort of sounds like it offers the benefits of extending a module with itself, but with some added granularity. Unfortunately, there is something about <code class="highlighter-rouge">module_function</code> that makes it quite weird to work with.</p>

<p>As it turns out, <code class="highlighter-rouge">module_function</code> works very different under the hood than self-mixins do. This is because <code class="highlighter-rouge">module_function</code> actually doesn’t manipulate the method lookup path, but instead, it makes a direct copy of the specified methods and attaches them to the module itself. If that sounds too weird to be true, check out the code below.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">Greeter</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">hello</span>
    <span class="s2">"hi"</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="kp">module_function</span> <span class="ss">:hello</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">hello</span>
    <span class="s2">"howdy"</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="no">Greeter</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">hello</span> <span class="c1">#=&gt; "hi"</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Foo</span>
  <span class="kp">include</span> <span class="no">Greeter</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="no">Foo</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">hello</span> <span class="c1">#=&gt; "howdy"</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Pretty weird behavior, right? You may find it interesting to know that I was not actually aware that <code class="highlighter-rouge">module_function</code> made copies of methods until I wrote Issue #10 and was tipped off about this by one of our readers. However, I did know about one of the consequences of <code class="highlighter-rouge">module_function</code> being implemented in this way: private methods cannot be used in conjunction with <code class="highlighter-rouge">module_function</code>. That means that the following example cannot be literally translated to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">module_function</code>.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">MinimalAnswer</span>
  <span class="kp">extend</span> <span class="nb">self</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">match?</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">pattern</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">input</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">pattern</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">split</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sr">/,/</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">any?</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">e</span><span class="o">|</span>
      <span class="n">normalize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">input</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=~</span> <span class="sr">/\b</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">normalize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">e</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="sr">/i</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="kp">private</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">normalize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">input</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">input</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">downcase</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">strip</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">gsub</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sr">/\s+/</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">" "</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">gsub</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sr">/[?.!\-,:'"]/</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">''</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span> 
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>From these examples, we see that <code class="highlighter-rouge">module_function</code> is more flexible than defining methods directly on your modules, but not nearly as versatile as extending a module with itself. While the ability to selectively define which methods can be called directly on the module is nice in theory, I’ve yet to see a use case for it where it would lead to a much better design.</p>

<h3 id="reflections">Reflections</h3>

<p>With the alternatives to <code class="highlighter-rouge">extend self</code> having unpleasant quirks, it’s no surprise that they’re quickly falling out of fashion in the Ruby world. But since no technical decision should be made based on dogma or a blind-faith acceptance of community conventions, these notes hopefully provide the necessary evidence to help you make good design decisions on your own.</p>
