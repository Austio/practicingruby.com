    <p><em>This article was contributed by Carol Nichols

Through Math</a>.</em></p>

<p>Whenever our code breaks, it can be hard to remain calm. Debugging
often occurs when production is down, customers are experiencing a problem, and
managers are asking for status updates every five minutes. In this situation, panicking
is a natural response, but it can easily disrupt your troubleshooting process. It may
lead to changing code on hunches rather than on evidence or writing
untested code. By rushing to fix things immediately, you may make
things worse or not know which of your changes actually
fixed the problem. As many of us have learned the hard way: a
chaotic debugging process is no fun for you, and no fun for the people
who rely on your software.</p>

<p>Having a calm and collected way of approaching software defects goes a long way,
especially if you also have a firm grasp of the tools and techniques that can
help make the debugging process easier. This article is meant to help you with
both of those things, so let’s get started.</p>

<h2 id="dont-panic">Don’t Panic!</h2>

<p>If external pressures are stressing you out, either disable
the feature that is causing the problem, or roll the production code back to a known
stable state before attempting to investigate further. Even
if it isn’t ideal from a usability standpoint, functioning software with a
few missing features is still more useful than unstable and potentially
dangerous software.</p>

<p>Once you’ve reproduced the issue in a development environment, you can start to narrow down the problem using
a divide-and-conquer strategy. If you suspect the problem is coming from your
application code, you might try starting with an end-to-end reproduction and
then gradually eliminate components until you find the source of the issue.
However, if you think the issues are coming from the infrastructure your
project is built on top of (libraries, services, frameworks, and even Ruby
itself!), it might be better to start with minimal stand-alone examples to test your 
assumptions about your application’s integration points. Picking a good 
angle of attack depends on the nature of the problem, so don’t be afraid to spend some time
figuring out the right questions to ask – even if you’re under pressure.</p>

<p>Regardless of your starting point, you won’t be guaranteed to find the source
of your problem right away. However, each new experiment you try out will add yet another constraint to your 
problem space, making it easier to reason about what is going
wrong. The fear of the unknown is a big part of what causes us to panic in the
first place, and so this approach will help you build up the confidence you
need in order to maintain a calm mindset as you work.</p>

<p>Throughout the rest of this article, we’ll discuss some things that will 
help you find bugs, fix them, and make sure they stay fixed. But keep 
this in mind: they work best if you don’t panic!</p>

<h2 id="read-stack-traces">Read stack traces</h2>

<p>Stack traces are ugly. They typically present themselves as a wall of text 
in your terminal when you aren’t expecting them. When pairing, I’ve often seen people
ignore stack traces entirely and just start changing the code. But stack
traces do have valuable information in them, and learning to pick out the
useful parts of the stack trace can save you a lot of time in trying to narrow
down the problem.</p>

<p>The two most valuable pieces of information are the resulting error message
(which is usually shown at the beginning of the stack trace in Ruby) and the
last line of your code that was involved (which is often in middle). The
error message will tell you <em>what</em> went wrong, and the last line of your
code will tell you <em>where</em> the problem is coming from.</p>

<p>A particularly horrible stack trace is <a href="https://gist.github.com/carols10cents/4751381/raw/b75bdb41e7fa8ded54d13dc786808b464357effe/gistfile1.txt">this 1400 line trace</a>
from a Rails app using JRuby running on websphere. In this case, the error message
<em>“ERROR [Default Executor-thread-15]”</em> is not very helpful. The vast majority of the lines are
coming from JRuby’s Java code and are also uninformative. However, skimming
through and looking for lines that don’t fit in, there are some lines that are
longer than the others (shown wrapped and trimmed below for clarity):</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>rubyjit.ApplicationHelper
  $$entity_label_5C9C81BAF0BBC4018616956A9F87C663730CB52E.
  __file__(/..LONGPREFIX../app/helpers/application_helper.rb:232)
  
rubyjit.ApplicationHelper
  $$entity_label_5C9C81BAF0BBC4018616956A9F87C663730CB52E
  .__file__(/..LONGPREFIX../app/helpers/application_helper.rb)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>These lines of the stack trace point to the last line of the Rails code that
was involved, line 232 of <em>application_helper.rb</em>. But this particular line
of code was simply concatenating two strings together – making it pretty
clear that the problem was not caused by our application code! By trying
various  values for those strings, we eventually found the cause of the
problem: an <a href="https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/366">encoding-related bug</a> in
JRuby was causing a Ruby 1.9 specific feature to be called from within Ruby 1.8
mode. Even though our stack trace was very unpleasant to read and did not
provide us with a useful error message, tracing the exception down to a
particular line number was essential for identifying what would have otherwise
been a needle in a haystack.</p>

<p>Of course, there are some edge cases where line numbers are not very helpful. One is
the dreaded <em>“syntax error, unexpected $end, expecting keyword_end”</em> error, which
will usually point to the end of one of your files. It actually means you’re
missing an <code class="highlighter-rouge">end</code> somewhere in that file. However, these situations are rare, and
so it makes sense to skim stack traces for relevant line numbers
that might give you a clue about where your bug is coming from.</p>

<p>If all else fails, you can always try doing a web search for the name of the
exception and its message – even if the results aren’t directly related to your
issue, they may give you useful hints that can help you discover the right
questions to ask about your problem.</p>

<h2 id="use-debugging-tools">Use debugging tools</h2>

<p>Debugging tools (such as ruby-debug) are useful because they allow you to inspect your code and its 
environment while it’s actually running. However, this is also true about using
a REPL (such as irb), and many Rubyists tend to strongly prefer the latter
because it is a comfortable workflow for more than just troubleshooting.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://pryrepl.org/">Pry</a> REPL is becoming increasingly popular, because it
attempts to serve as both a debugger and an interactive console simultaneously.
Placing the <code class="highlighter-rouge">binding.pry</code> command anywhere in your codebase will launch you into
a Pry session whenever that line of code is executed. From there, you can do
things like inspect the values in variables or run some arbitrary code. Much like 
irb, this lets you try out ideas and hypotheses quickly. If you can’t easily
think of a way to capture the debugging information you need with some simple
print statements or a logger, it’s a sign that using Pry might get you 
somewhere.</p>

<p>This kind of workflow is especially useful when control flow gets complicated,
such as when working with events or threads. For example, suppose we wanted to
get a closer look at the behavior of <a href="https://github.com/elm-city-craftworks/practicing-ruby-examples/blob/master/v6/003/lib/actors.rb">the actor model</a>
from the Dining Philosopher’s problem from <a href="https://practicingruby.com/articles/100">Issue 6.3</a>. 
Here’s how we would inspect what’s happening in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Waiter#request_to_eat</code>
method:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s2">"pry"</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Waiter</span>
  <span class="c1"># ...</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">request_to_eat</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">philosopher</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="nb">binding</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">pry</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="vi">@eating</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">include?</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">philosopher</span><span class="p">)</span>

    <span class="vi">@eating</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="n">philosopher</span>
    <span class="n">philosopher</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">async</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">eat</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Because the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Waiter</code> class is an actor, it will execute the requests to eat in
sequence, but they will be queued up asynchronously. As soon as one is
actually executed, we will be dropped into a Pry session:</p>

<pre><code class="language-console">From: (..)/dining_philosophers.rb @ line 61 Waiter#request_to_eat:

    60: def request_to_eat(philosopher)
 =&gt; 61:   binding.pry
    62:   return if @eating.include?(philosopher)
    63:
    64:   @eating &lt;&lt; philosopher
    65:   philosopher.async.eat
    66: end

[1] pry(#&lt;Waiter&gt;)&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>From here, we can deeply interrogate the current state of our program,
revealing that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">philosopher</code> references an <code class="highlighter-rouge">Actor::Proxy</code> 
object, which in turn wraps a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Philosopher</code> object 
(Schopenhauer in this case):</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code># NOTE: this output cleaned up somewhat for clarity

[1] pry(#&lt;Waiter&gt;)&gt; ls philosopher
Actor::Proxy#methods: async  method_missing  send_later  terminate
instance variables: @async_proxy  @mailbox  @mutex  @running  @target  @thread
[2] pry(#&lt;Waiter&gt;)&gt; cd philosopher/@target
[3] pry(#&lt;Philosopher&gt;):2&gt; ls
Philosopher#methods: dine  drop_chopsticks  eat  take_chopsticks  think
self.methods: __pry__
instance variables: @left_chopstick  @name  @right_chopstick  @waiter
locals: _  __  _dir_  _ex_  _file_  _in_  _out_  _pry_
[4] pry(#&lt;Philosopher&gt;):2&gt; @name
=&gt; "Schopenhauer"
[5] pry(#&lt;Philosopher&gt;):2&gt; cd
[6] pry(#&lt;Waiter&gt;)&gt; @eating.count
=&gt; 0
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Once we’re ready to move on to the next call to <code class="highlighter-rouge">request_to_eat</code>, we simply call
<code class="highlighter-rouge">exit</code>. That immediately launches a new console that allows us to determine
that Schopenhauer’s is already in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">@eating</code> queue by the time Aristotle’s request
is starting to be processed:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>[1] pry(#&lt;Waiter&gt;)&gt; cd philosopher/@target
[2] pry(#&lt;Philosopher&gt;):2&gt; @name
=&gt; "Aristotle"
[3] pry(#&lt;Philosopher&gt;):2&gt; cd
[4] pry(#&lt;Waiter&gt;)&gt; @eating.count
=&gt; 1
[5] pry(#&lt;Waiter&gt;)&gt; cd @eating.first/@target
[6] pry(#&lt;Philosopher&gt;):2&gt; @name
=&gt; "Schopenhauer"
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Imagine for a moment that there was a defect in this code. Replicating this 
exact situation in a test where we can access the values of
<code class="highlighter-rouge">@eating</code> and the internals of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">philosopher</code> argument at these 
particular points in the execution would
not be straightforward, but Pry makes it easier to casually poke at these
values as part of an ad-hoc exploration. If there was a bug to be found here,
Pry could help you identify the conditions that trigger it, and then other
techniques could be used to reproduce the issue once its root cause
was discovered.</p>

<p>This particular use case merely scratches the surface of Pry’s capabilities – 
there are many commands that Pry provides that are powerful tools for inspecting your
code while it’s running. That said, it is not a complete substitute for
a traditional debugger. For example, gdb can be useful for hunting down
hard-to-investigate issues such as segfaults in MRI’s C code. If you’re interested in that kind
of thing, you may want to check out <a href="http://vimeo.com/54736113">this talk from Heath Lilley</a>
about using gdb to determine why a Ruby program was crashing.</p>

<p>You don’t always need to use a heavyweight debugging utility to solve
your problems. Whenever you can get away with it, it’s reasonable to use the
most simple thing that could possibly work; it’s amazing how much a decent log
file or some well placed print statements can tell you about what’s going on in
your code. But whenever you feel like those approaches are starting to get
cumbersome, don’t be afraid to break out the power tools.</p>

<h2 id="lean-on-tests-but-dont-overspecify">Lean on tests, but don’t overspecify</h2>

<p>Whenever you need to fix a bug, you’re writing a test first, right? This
serves multiple purposes: it gives you a convenient way to reproduce the issue
while you’re experimenting, and if added to your test suite, it will help
you detect regressions in future changes.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether the tests you write end up becoming a permanent part of
your test suite or not, they still provide a useful way to record your 
discoveries and experiments during a debugging session. For example, you might 
start with an end-to-end acceptance test that is able to reproduce the problem 
and then write smaller and smaller tests as you are narrowing down where the 
issue is occurring until you get to a unit test that covers the root cause.
From there, you can fix the issue, run all the tests to confirm the fix, 
and then finally remove the redundant tests that only reproduce the problem 
indirectly.</p>

<p>But why bother removing intermediate tests? It’s mostly just a matter of
good housekeeping that helps maintain the clarity of your test suite. For
example, negative tests like “it should not crash when given special characters” 
are mostly just noise at the acceptance test level, unless someone could
reasonably assume that the tested feature wouldn’t support that use case.
For a real example of this kind of over-specification, here is a test that I 
added to <a href="https://github.com/hotsh/rstat.us/commit/26444ea95ec8da12d4e74764bf52bdaad18e7776">rstat.us’ codebase</a>
a while ago:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">it</span> <span class="s2">"lets you update your profile even if you use a different case in the url"</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="n">u</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Factory</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:user</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:username</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"LADY_GAGA"</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Factory</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:authorization</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:user</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">u</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">log_in</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">u</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">uid</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">visit</span> <span class="s2">"/users/lady_gaga/edit"</span>
  <span class="n">bio_text</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"To be or not to be"</span>
  <span class="n">fill_in</span> <span class="s2">"bio"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:with</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">bio_text</span>

<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Rather than adding another test for the case of going to the url for username
“lady_gaga” when the username is “LADY_GAGA” (don’t ask why I chose Lady Gaga,
I don’t remember), I could have instead updated
<a href="https://github.com/hotsh/rstat.us/blob/26444ea95ec8da12d4e74764bf52bdaad18e7776/test/acceptance/profile_test.rb#L45">the existing happy path test</a>
to encompass this situation (effectively replacing the existing happy path test
with this special case test). In this way, both the special case and the happy path
would be tested, but with less duplication.</p>

<p>If in doubt, it’s probably better to have a few extra tests cornering a defect
than too few, but just keep in mind that like all other code, your tests have a
maintenance overhead along with a potential to become brittle. As with
all things, having a sense of balance pays off here.</p>

<h2 id="reflections">Reflections</h2>

<p>Even though sometimes it seems like software has a mind of its own, computers
only do what a human has told them to do at some point. So next time you end up
facing a painful defect, remember the following things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You can figure out why a bug is happening by using deterministic processes to narrow down where the
problem is happening.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can learn to pick out the useful parts of stack traces, even if they
seem heavily obfuscated at first.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can use debugging tools to experiment with what your code is
actually doing as it runs, especially in cases where it wouldn’t
be easy to work out what was going on straight from your log files.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can write tests that help you while debugging and then turn some
or all of them into useful regression tests that will help make your
codebase more stable as it grows.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks for reading. Now go figure out some bugs! &lt;3</p>
