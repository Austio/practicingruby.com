    <p><em>This article was written by Luke Francl, a Ruby developer living in
San Francisco. He is a developer at <a href="https://swiftype.com">Swiftype</a> where he
works on everything from web crawling to answering support requests.</em></p>

<p>Implementing a simpler version of a technology that you use every day can
help you understand it better. In this article, we will apply this
technique by building a simple HTTP server in Ruby.</p>

<p>By the time you’re done reading, you will know how to serve files from your
computer to a web browser with no dependencies other than a few standard
libraries that ship with Ruby. Although the server
we build will not be robust or anywhere near feature complete,
it will allow you to look under the hood of one of the most fundamental
pieces of technology that we all use on a regular basis.</p>

<h2 id="a-very-brief-introduction-to-http">A (very) brief introduction to HTTP</h2>

<p>We all use web applications daily and many of us build
them for a living, but much of our work is done far above the HTTP level.
We’ll need come down from the clouds a bit in order to explore
what happens at the protocol level when someone clicks a 
link to <em>http://example.com/file.txt</em> in their web browser.</p>

<p>The following steps roughly cover the typical HTTP request/response lifecycle:</p>

<p>1) The browser issues an HTTP request by opening a TCP socket connection to
<code class="highlighter-rouge">example.com</code> on port 80. The server accepts the connection, opening a
socket for bi-directional communication.</p>

<p>2) When the connection has been made, the HTTP client sends a HTTP request:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>GET /file.txt HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: ExampleBrowser/1.0
Host: example.com
Accept: */*
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>3) The server then parses the request. The first line is the Request-Line which contains
the HTTP method (<code class="highlighter-rouge">GET</code>), Request-URI (<code class="highlighter-rouge">/file.txt</code>), and HTTP version (<code class="highlighter-rouge">1.1</code>).
Subsequent lines are headers, which consists of key-value pairs delimited by <code class="highlighter-rouge">:</code>. 
After the headers is a blank line followed by an optional message body (not shown in
this example).</p>

<p>4) Using the same connection, the server responds with the contents of the file:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Length: 13
Connection: close

hello world
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>5) After finishing the response, the server closes the socket to terminate the connection.</p>

<p>The basic workflow shown above is one of HTTP’s most simple use cases,
but it is also one of the most common interactions handled by web servers.
Let’s jump right into implementing it!</p>

<h2 id="writing-the-hello-world-http-server">Writing the “Hello World” HTTP server</h2>

<p>To begin, let’s build the simplest thing that could possibly work: a web server
that always responds “Hello World” with HTTP 200 to any request. The following
code mostly follows the process outlined in the previous section, but is
commented line-by-line to help you understand its implementation details:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'socket'</span> <span class="c1"># Provides TCPServer and TCPSocket classes</span>

<span class="c1"># connection at a time.</span>
<span class="kp">loop</span> <span class="k">do</span>

  <span class="c1"># Wait until a client connects, then return a TCPSocket</span>
  <span class="c1"># that can be used in a similar fashion to other Ruby</span>

  <span class="n">socket</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">server</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">accept</span>

  <span class="c1"># We need to include the Content-Type and Content-Length headers</span>
  <span class="c1"># to let the client know the size and type of data</span>
  <span class="c1"># contained in the response. Note that HTTP is whitespace</span>
  <span class="c1"># sensitive, and expects each header line to end with CRLF (i.e. "\r\n")</span>
  <span class="n">socket</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">print</span> <span class="s2">"HTTP/1.1 200 OK</span><span class="se">\r\n</span><span class="s2">"</span> <span class="o">+</span>

               <span class="s2">"Connection: close</span><span class="se">\r\n</span><span class="s2">"</span>

  <span class="c1"># Print a blank line to separate the header from the response body,</span>

  <span class="n">socket</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">print</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="se">\r\n</span><span class="s2">"</span>

  <span class="c1"># Print the actual response body, which is just "Hello World!\n"</span>
  <span class="n">socket</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">print</span> <span class="n">response</span>

  <span class="c1"># Close the socket, terminating the connection</span>
  <span class="n">socket</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">close</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>To test your server, run this code and then try opening <code class="highlighter-rouge">http://localhost:2345/anything</code>
in a browser. You should see the “Hello world!” message. Meanwhile, in the output for
the HTTP server, you should see the request being logged:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>GET /anything HTTP/1.1
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Next, open another shell and test it with <code class="highlighter-rouge">curl</code>:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>curl --verbose -XGET http://localhost:2345/anything
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You’ll see the detailed request and response headers:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>* About to connect() to localhost port 2345 (#0)
*   Trying 127.0.0.1... connected
* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 2345 (#0)
&gt; GET /anything HTTP/1.1
&gt; User-Agent: curl/7.19.7 (universal-apple-darwin10.0) libcurl/7.19.7
              OpenSSL/0.9.8r zlib/1.2.3
&gt; Host: localhost:2345
&gt; Accept: */*
&gt;
&lt; HTTP/1.1 200 OK
&lt; Content-Type: text/plain
&lt; Content-Length: 13
&lt; Connection: close
&lt;
Hello world!
* Closing connection #0
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Congratulations, you’ve written a simple HTTP server! Now we’ll 
build a more useful one.</p>

<h2 id="serving-files-over-http">Serving files over HTTP</h2>

<p>We’re about to build a more realistic program that is capable of 
serving files over HTTP, rather than simply responding to any request
with “Hello World”. In order to do that, we’ll need to make a few 
changes to the way our server works.</p>

<p>For each incoming request, we’ll parse the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Request-URI</code> header and translate it into
a path to a file within the server’s public folder. If we’re able to find a match, we’ll
respond with its contents, using the file’s size to determine the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Content-Length</code>,
and its extension to determine the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Content-Type</code>. If no matching file can be found,
we’ll respond with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">404 Not Found</code> error status.</p>

<p>Most of these changes are fairly straightforward to implement, but mapping the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Request-URI</code> to a path on the server’s filesystem is a bit more complicated due
to security issues. To simplify things a bit, let’s assume for the moment that a
<code class="highlighter-rouge">requested_file</code> function has been implemented for us already that can handle
this task safely. Then we could build a rudimentary HTTP file server in the following way:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'socket'</span>
<span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'uri'</span>

<span class="c1"># Files will be served from this directory</span>
<span class="no">WEB_ROOT</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'./public'</span>

<span class="c1"># Map extensions to their content type</span>
<span class="no">CONTENT_TYPE_MAPPING</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="s1">'html'</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s1">'text/html'</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s1">'txt'</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s1">'text/plain'</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s1">'png'</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s1">'image/png'</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s1">'jpg'</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s1">'image/jpeg'</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c1"># Treat as binary data if content type cannot be found</span>
<span class="no">DEFAULT_CONTENT_TYPE</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'application/octet-stream'</span>

<span class="c1"># This helper function parses the extension of the</span>
<span class="c1"># requested file and then looks up its content type.</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">content_type</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">path</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">ext</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">File</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">extname</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">path</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">split</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"."</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">last</span>
  <span class="no">CONTENT_TYPE_MAPPING</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">fetch</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ext</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">DEFAULT_CONTENT_TYPE</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="c1"># This helper function parses the Request-Line and</span>

  <span class="c1"># ... implementation details to be discussed later ...</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="c1"># Except where noted below, the general approach of</span>
<span class="c1"># handling requests and generating responses is</span>
<span class="c1"># similar to that of the "Hello World" example</span>
<span class="c1"># shown earlier.</span>

<span class="n">server</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">TCPServer</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'localhost'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2345</span><span class="p">)</span>

</div>

<p>Although there is a lot more code here than what we saw in the
“Hello World” example, most of it is routine file manipulation
similar to the kind we’d encounter in everyday code. Now there
is only one more feature left to implement before we can serve
files over HTTP: the <code class="highlighter-rouge">requested_file</code> method.</p>

<h2 id="safely-converting-a-uri-into-a-file-path">Safely converting a URI into a file path</h2>

<p>Practically speaking, mapping the Request-Line to a file on the 
server’s filesystem is easy: you extract the Request-URI, scrub 
out any parameters and URI-encoding, and then finally turn that 
into a path to a file in the server’s public folder:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># Takes a request line (e.g. "GET /path?foo=bar HTTP/1.1")</span>
<span class="c1"># and extracts the path from it, scrubbing out parameters</span>
<span class="c1"># and unescaping URI-encoding.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># This cleaned up path (e.g. "/path") is then converted into</span>
<span class="c1"># a relative path to a file in the server's public folder</span>
<span class="c1"># by joining it with the WEB_ROOT.</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">requested_file</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">request_line</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">request_uri</span>  <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">request_line</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">split</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">" "</span><span class="p">)[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span>
  <span class="n">path</span>         <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">URI</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">unescape</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">URI</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">request_uri</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">path</span><span class="p">)</span>

  <span class="no">File</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">join</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">WEB_ROOT</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">path</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>However, this implementation has a very bad security problem that has affected
many, many web servers and CGI scripts over the years: the server will happily
serve up any file, even if it’s outside the <code class="highlighter-rouge">WEB_ROOT</code>.</p>

<p>Consider a request like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>GET /../../../../etc/passwd HTTP/1.1
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>On my system, when <code class="highlighter-rouge">File.join</code> is called on this path, the “..” path components
will cause it escape the <code class="highlighter-rouge">WEB_ROOT</code> directory and serve the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/etc/passwd</code> file.
Yikes! We’ll need to sanitize the path before use in order to prevent this
kind of problem.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you want to try to reproduce this issue on your own machine,
you may need to use a low level tool like <em>curl</em> to demonstrate it. Some browsers change the path to remove the “..” before sending a request to the server.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because security code is notoriously difficult to get right, we will borrow our
implementation from <a href="https://github.com/rack/rack/blob/master/lib/rack/file.rb">Rack::File</a>.
The approach shown below was actually added to <code class="highlighter-rouge">Rack::File</code> in response to a <a href="http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-0262">similar
security vulnerability</a> that
was disclosed in early 2013:</p>

</div>

<p>To test this implementation (and finally see your file server in action), 
replace the <code class="highlighter-rouge">requested_file</code> stub in the example from the previous section 
with the implementation shown above, and then create an <code class="highlighter-rouge">index.html</code> file 
in a <code class="highlighter-rouge">public/</code> folder that is contained within the same directory as your
server script. Upon running the script, you should be able to 
visit <code class="highlighter-rouge">http://localhost:2345/index.html</code> but NOT be able to reach any
files outside of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">public/</code> folder.</p>

<h2 id="serving-up-indexhtml-implicitly">Serving up index.html implicitly</h2>

<p>If you visit <code class="highlighter-rouge">http://localhost:2345</code> in your web browser, you’ll see a 404 Not
Found response, even though you’ve created an index.html file. Most real web
servers will serve an index file when the client requests a directory. Let’s
implement that.</p>

<p>This change is more simple than it seems, and can be accomplished by adding
a single line of code to our server script:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code># ...
path = requested_file(request_line)

<span class="gi">+ path = File.join(path, 'index.html') if File.directory?(path)
</span>
if File.exist?(path) &amp;&amp; !File.directory?(path)
# ...
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Doing so will cause any path that refers to a directory to have “/index.html” appended to
the end of it. This way, <code class="highlighter-rouge">/</code> becomes <code class="highlighter-rouge">/index.html</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">/path/to/dir</code> becomes
<code class="highlighter-rouge">path/to/dir/index.html</code>.</p>

<p>Perhaps surprisingly, the validations in our response code do not need
to be changed. Let’s recall what they look like and then examine why
that’s the case:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">if</span> <span class="no">File</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">exist?</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">path</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="no">File</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">directory?</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">path</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="c1"># serve up the file...</span>
<span class="k">else</span>
  <span class="c1"># respond with a 404</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Suppose a request is received for <code class="highlighter-rouge">/somedir</code>. That request will automatically be converted by our server into <code class="highlighter-rouge">/somedir/index.html</code>. If the index.html exists within <code class="highlighter-rouge">/somedir</code>, then it will be served up without any problems. However, if <code class="highlighter-rouge">/somedir</code> does not contain an <code class="highlighter-rouge">index.html</code> file, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">File.exist?</code> check will fail, causing the server to respond with a 404 error code. This is exactly what we want!</p>

<p>It may be tempting to think that this small change would make it possible to remove the <code class="highlighter-rouge">File.directory?</code> check, and in normal circumstances you might be able to safely do with it. However, because leaving it in prevents an error condition in the edge case where someone attempts to serve up a directory named <code class="highlighter-rouge">index.html</code>, we’ve decided to leave that validation as it is.</p>

<p>With this small improvement, our file server is now pretty much working as we’d expect it to. If you want to play with it some more, you can grab the <a href="https://github.com/elm-city-craftworks/practicing-ruby-examples/tree/master/v7/002">complete source code</a> from GitHub.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-go-from-here">Where to go from here</h2>

<p>In this article, we reviewed how HTTP works, then built a simple web
server that can serve up files from a directory. We’ve also examined
one of the most common security problems with web applications and
fixed it. If you’ve made it this far, congratulations! That’s a lot
to learn in one day.</p>

<p>However, it’s obvious that the server we’ve built is extremely limited.
If you want to continue in your studies, here are a few recommendations
for how to go about improving the server:</p>

<ul>
  <li>According to the HTTP 1.1 specification, a server must minimally
respond to GET and HEAD to be compliant. Implement the HEAD response.</li>
  <li>Add error handling that returns a 500 response to the client
if something goes wrong with the request.</li>
  <li>Make the web root directory and port configurable.</li>
  <li>Add support for POST requests. You could implement CGI by executing
a script when it matches the path, or implement 
the <a href="http://rack.rubyforge.org/doc/SPEC.html">Rack spec</a> to
let the server serve Rack apps with <code class="highlighter-rouge">call</code>.</li>
  <li>Reimplement the request loop using <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0/libdoc/gserver/rdoc/GServer.html">GServer</a>
(Ruby’s generic threaded server) to handle multiple connections.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please do share your experiences and code if you decide to try any of
these ideas, or if you come up with some improvement ideas of your own.
Happy hacking!</p>
