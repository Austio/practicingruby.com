<p>Modules are part of what makes Ruby’s design beautiful. However, since they do not have a direct analogy in any mainstream programming language, it is easy to get a bit confused about what they should be used for. While most folks quickly encounter at least some of their use cases, typically only very experienced Ruby developers know their true versatilty.</p>

<p>In this four part article series, I aim to demystify Ruby modules by showing many practical use cases, explaining some tricky details along the way. We’ll work through some of the fundamentals in the first two issues, and move into more advanced examples in the second two. Today we’ll kick off this series by looking at the most simple, but perhaps most important ability modules offer us, the creation of namespaces.</p>

<h3 id="modules-for-namespacing">Modules for Namespacing</h3>

<p>Imagine that you are writing an XML generation library, and in it, you have a class to generate your XML documents. Perhaps uncreatively, you choose the name <code class="highlighter-rouge">Document</code> for your class, creating something similar to what is shown below.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Document</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">generate</span>
    <span class="c1"># ...</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>On its own, this seems to make a lot of sense; a user could do something simple like the following to make use of your library.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s2">"your_xml_lib"</span>
<span class="n">document</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span>
<span class="c1"># do something with document</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">generate</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>But imagine that you were using another library that generates PDF documents, which happens to use similar uncreative naming for its class that does the PDF document generation. Then, the following code would look equally valid.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s2">"their_pdf_lib"</span>
<span class="n">document</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span>
<span class="c1"># do something with document</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">generate</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>As long as the two libraries were never loaded at the same time, there would be no issue. But as soon as someone loaded both libraries, some quite confusing behavior would happen. One might think that defining two different classes with the same name would lead to some sort of error being raised by Ruby, but with open classes, that is not the case. Ruby would actually apply the definitions of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Document</code> one after the other, with whatever file was required last taking precedence. The end result would in all likelihood be a very broken <code class="highlighter-rouge">Document</code> class that could generate neither XML nor PDF.</p>

<p>But there is no reason for this to happen, as long as both libraries take care to namespace things. Shown below is an example of two <code class="highlighter-rouge">Document</code> classes that could co-exist peacefully.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># somewhere in your_xml_lib</span>

<span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">XML</span>
  <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Document</span>
    <span class="c1"># ...</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="c1"># somewhere in their_pdf_lib</span>

<span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">PDF</span>
  <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Document</span>
    <span class="c1"># ...</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Using both classes in the same application is as easy, as long as you explicitly include the namespace when referring to each library’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">Document</code> class.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s2">"your_xml_lib"</span>
<span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s2">"their_pdf_lib"</span>

<span class="c1"># this pair of calls refer to two completely different classes</span>
<span class="n">pdf_document</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">PDF</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span>
<span class="n">xml_document</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">XML</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The clash has been prevented because each library has nested its <code class="highlighter-rouge">Document</code> class within a module, allowing the class to be defined within that namespace rather than at the global level. While this is a relatively straightforward concept, it’s important to note a few things about what is really going on here.</p>

<p>Firstly, namespacing actually applies to the way constants are looked up in Ruby in general, not classes in particular. This means that it applies to modules nested within modules as well as ordinary constants as well.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">A</span>
  <span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">B</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="nb">p</span> <span class="no">A</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">B</span>

<span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">A</span>
  <span class="no">C</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">10</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="nb">p</span> <span class="no">A</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">C</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Secondly, this same behavior of using modules as namespaces applies just as well to classes, as in the code below.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Blog</span>
  <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Comment</span>
    <span class="c1">#...</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Be sure to note that in this example, nesting a class within a class does not in any way make it a subclass or establish any relationship between <code class="highlighter-rouge">Blog</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Blog::Comment</code> except that <code class="highlighter-rouge">Blog::Comment</code> is within the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Blog</code> namespace. In the example below, you can see that a class nested within another class looks the same as a class nested within a module.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">blog</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Blog</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span>
<span class="n">comment</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Blog</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Comment</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span>
<span class="c1"># ...</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Of course, this technique is only really useful when you have a desired namespace for your library that also happens matches one of your class names. In all other situations, it makes sense to use a module for namespacing as it would prevent your users from creating instances of an empty and meaningless class.</p>

<p>Finally, it is important to understand that constants are looked up from the innermost nesting to the outermost, finally searching the global namespace. This can be a bit confusing at times, especially when you consider some corner cases.</p>

<p>For example, examine the following code:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">FancyReporter</span>
  <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Document</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">initialize</span>
       <span class="vi">@output</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">String</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>

    <span class="kp">attr_reader</span> <span class="ss">:output</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If you load this code into irb and play with a bit on its own, you can inspect an instance of Document to see that its output attribute is a core ruby <code class="highlighter-rouge">String</code> object, as shown below:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="no">FancyReporter</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">output</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">""</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="no">FancyReporter</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">output</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">class</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="no">String</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>While this seems fairly obvious, it is easy for a bit of unrelated code written elsewhere to change everything. Consider the following code:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">FancyReporter</span>
  <span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">String</span>
    <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Formatter</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>While the designer of <code class="highlighter-rouge">FancyReporter</code> was most likely trying to be well organized by offering <code class="highlighter-rouge">FancyReporter::String::Formatter</code>, this small change causes headaches because it changes the meaning of <code class="highlighter-rouge">String.new</code> in <code class="highlighter-rouge">Document</code>’s initialize method. In fact, you cannot even create an instance of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Document</code> before the following error is raised:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="sc">?&gt;</span> <span class="no">FancyReporter</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span>
<span class="no">NoMethodError</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">undefined</span> <span class="nb">method</span> <span class="sb">`new' for FancyReporter::String:Module
	from (irb):35:in `</span><span class="kp">initialize</span><span class="s1">'
	from (irb):53:in `new'</span>
	<span class="n">from</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">irb</span><span class="p">):</span><span class="mi">53</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>There are a number of ways this problem can be avoided. Often times, it’s
possible to come up with alternative names that do not clash with core objects,
and when that’s the case, it’s preferable. In this particular case, <code class="highlighter-rouge">String.new</code>
can also be replaced with <code class="highlighter-rouge">""</code>, as nothing can change what objects are created
via Ruby’s string literal syntax. But there is also an approach that works
independent of context, and that is to use explicit constant lookups from the
global namespace. You can see an example of explicit lookups in the following
code:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">FancyReporter</span>
  <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Document</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">initialize</span>
       <span class="vi">@output</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">::</span><span class="no">String</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>

    <span class="kp">attr_reader</span> <span class="ss">:output</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Prepending any constant with <code class="highlighter-rouge">::</code> will force Ruby to skip the nested namespaces and bubble all the way up to the root. In this sense, the difference between <code class="highlighter-rouge">A::B</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">::A::B</code> is that the former is a sort of relative lookup whereas the latter is absolute from the root namespace.</p>

<p>In general, having to use absolute lookups may be a sign that there is an unnecessary name conflict within your application. But if upon investigation you find names that inheritently collide with one another, you can use this tool to avoid any ambiguity in your code.</p>

<p>While we’ve mostly covered the mechanics of namespacing, all this talk about <code class="highlighter-rouge">::</code> compels me to share a cautionary tale of mass cargoculting before we wrap up for today. Please bear with me as I stroke my beard for a moment.</p>

<h3 id="abusing-the-constant-lookup-operator-">Abusing the Constant Lookup Operator (<code class="highlighter-rouge">::</code>)</h3>

<p>In some older documentation, and some relatively recent code written by folks who learned from old documentation, you may see class methods being called in the manner shown below.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="no">YAML</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="nb">load</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">File</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">read</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"foo.yaml"</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>While the above code runs fine, it’s only a historical accident that it does. In fact, <code class="highlighter-rouge">::</code> was never meant for method invocation, class methods or otherwise. You can easily demonstrate that <code class="highlighter-rouge">::</code> can be used to execute instance methods as well, which eliminates any notion that <code class="highlighter-rouge">::</code> has some special ‘class methods only’ distinction to it.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="s2">"foo"</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">reverse</span> <span class="c1">#=&gt; "oof"</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>As far as I can tell, this style of method invocation actually came about as a documentation convention. In both formal documentation and in mailing list discussions, it can sometimes be difficult to discern whether someone is talking about a class method or instance method, since both can be called just as well with the dot operator. So, a convention was invented so that for a class <code class="highlighter-rouge">Foo</code>, the instance method <code class="highlighter-rouge">bar</code> would be referred to as <code class="highlighter-rouge">Foo#bar</code>, and the class method <code class="highlighter-rouge">bar</code> would be referred to as <code class="highlighter-rouge">Foo::bar</code>. This did away with the dot entirely, leaving no room for ambiguity.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this lead to a confusing situation. Beginners would often type <code class="highlighter-rouge">Foo#bar</code> to try to call instance methods, but were at least promptly punished for doing so because such code will not run at all. However, typing <code class="highlighter-rouge">Foo::bar</code> does work! Thus, an entire generation of Ruby developers were born thinking that <code class="highlighter-rouge">::</code> is some sort of special operator for calling class methods, and to an extent, others followed suit as a new convention emerged.</p>

<p>The fact that <code class="highlighter-rouge">::</code> will happily call methods for you has to do with internal implementation details of MRI, and so it’s actually an undefined behavior, subject to change. As far as I know, there is no guarantee it will actually work as expected, and so it shouldn’t be relied upon.</p>

<p>In your code, you should feel free to replace any method calls that use this style with ordinary <code class="highlighter-rouge">Foo.bar</code> calls. This actually reflects more of the true nature of Ruby, in that it doesn’t emphasize the difference between class level calls and instance level calls, since that distinction isn’t especially important. In documentation, things are a little trickier, but it is now generally accepted that <code class="highlighter-rouge">Foo.bar</code> refers to a class method and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Foo#bar</code> refers to an instance method. In cases where that distinction alone might be confusing, you could always be explicit, as in the example below.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">obj</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">bar</span> <span class="c1"># obj is an instance of Foo</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If this argument wasn’t convincing enough, you should know that every time you replace a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Foo::bar</code> call with <code class="highlighter-rouge">Foo.bar</code>, a brand new baby unicorn is born beneath a magnificent double rainbow. That should be reason enough to reverse this outdated practice, right?</p>
