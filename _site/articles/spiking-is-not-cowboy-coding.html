<p>When used in moderation, experimental spikes can be a very powerful tool for
shining some light into the dark corners of your projects. However, there is
a natural tension between chaotic spiking and formal TDD practices 
that needs to be balanced if you want to use the two techniques 
side by side. Equalizing these forces can be very challenging, and
it is something that I have struggled with throughout my career.</p>

<p>Because I started programming as a self-taught hobbyist, I spent many years
writing code without a well defined process. As I started to work
on larger and more important projects, I learned how to program in a
more disciplined way. I developed an interest in object-oriented design 
and also picked up the basics of test-driven development. These methodologies
helped me work in a more controlled fashion when I needed to, but they did not do 
much to change my everyday coding habits. I still relied on lots of messy
experimentation; I just knew how to clean up my code so that I didn’t
end up shipping sloppy work in the end.</p>

<p>While I have managed to be very productive over the years, my day to day 
efficiency has been very unpredictable because of the way that I do things. This
is something I have been aware of for some time, and was one of the 
main problems that I wanted to take a closer look at during 
this study. With that in mind, I will now walk you through three 
examples of where I broke away from TDD to try out some experiments and
then share my thoughts on what worked and what didn’t work.</p>

<h3 id="exploring-the-unknown">Exploring the unknown</h3>

<p>I knew when I started working on <a href="https://github.com/elm-city-craftworks/blind">Blind</a> 
that I would need to learn how to do two
things with the <a href="http://mon-ouie.github.com/projects/ray.html">Ray</a> game engine
that I hadn’t done before: work with positional 
audio, and write tests against the UI layer. I knew that these things were
supported by Ray because the documentation had examples for them, but I needed
to convince myself that they would work in practice by building a small proof of
concept.</p>

<p>Rather than trying to build realistic examples that matched how I would end up
using these features, I instead focused on their most basic prerequisites. For
example, I knew that I’d never be able to have dynamically positioned sound 
emitters in a three-dimensional space if I couldn’t play a simple beeping 
sound without any positioning at all. I also saw from the documentation that
in order to write tests against Ray it was necessary to use its class-based API
rather than using its fancy DSL. Combining those two ideas together lead me to
build the following (almost trivial) spike solution:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s2">"ray"</span>

</div>

<p>While this code was little more than the end result of mixing a
couple examples from Ray’s documentation together, it helped me verify 
that there weren’t any problems playing sounds on my system, and that
the documentation I was reading was up to date.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, this tiny script helped me notice that my wife’s
laptop was missing the core audio dependencies that Ray needed; 
which is a perfect example of what this kind of spike is made to test. It also
gave me an opportunity to answer some questions that the documentation
didn’t make clear to me. For example, removing the <code class="highlighter-rouge">sleep</code> call made me realize
that playing a sound was a non-blocking operation, and deleting the <code class="highlighter-rouge">render</code>
method made me realize that it only needed to be provided if it was doing
something useful. In a fairly complex and immature project like Ray, this
kind of trial-and-error based investigation is often a faster way to 
find answers than digging through source code.</p>

<p>I was actually very happy with the outcomes from this spike, and the effort I
put into it was minimal compared to what I got out of it. While I can’t say
the same for the other experiments I am about to show you, this little script
serves as a nice example of spiking done right.</p>

<h3 id="trying-out-a-new-design">Trying out a new design</h3>

<p>Mid-way through working on Blind, I decided to completely change the way I
was modeling things. All elements in the game were originally modeled as 
rectangles, but as I tweaked the game rules, I started to realize that all I
really cared about was point-to-point distance between the player and various
locations in the world. The hoops I was having to jump through to work with
rectangular game elements eventually got annoying enough that I decided to try
out my new ideas on an experimental branch.</p>

<p>I started working on this redesign from the bottom up, test-driving a couple
supporting objects that I knew I’d need, including a very boring <code class="highlighter-rouge">Point</code> class.
Despite the smooth start, it eventually became clear to me that this approach 
would only take me so far: the original <code class="highlighter-rouge">Game</code> class was tightly 
coupled to a particular representation of Blind’s world. To make matters 
worse, the UI code I had written was a messy prototype 
that I hadn’t cleaned up or tested properly yet. These issues 
left me stuck between a rock and a hard place.</p>

<p>I had already sunk a lot of time into building the new object model, but didn’t
want to keep investing in it without being reasonably sure that it was the right
way to go. To build up my confidence, I decided to do a quick spike to transform
the old UI into something that could work on top of the new object model.</p>

<p>Within an hour or two, I had a working game running on top of the new codebase. 
I made several minor changes and added a couple new features
to various objects in the process of doing so, without writing any tests for
them. I originally assumed that I didn’t need to write tests because I expected
to throw all this code away, but after wrapping up my experiment I decided that
the code was good enough to merge could be easily cleaned up later. This decision
eventually came back to haunt me.</p>

<p>Over the next several days, I ran into small bugs in various edge case
scenarios in the code that had been implemented during the spike. For example,
the randomized positioning of mines and exit locations had not been rewritten to
account for the fact that the game no longer defined regions as rectangles, and
that would occasionally cause them to spawn in the wrong regions. The following
patch was required to fix that problem:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>       @current_position = Blind::Point.new(0,0)
 
       @mine_positions   = mine_count.times.map do
<span class="gd">-        Blind::Point.new(rand(MINE_FIELD_RANGE), rand(MINE_FIELD_RANGE))
</span><span class="gi">+        random_minefield_position
</span>       end
 
<span class="gd">-      @exit_position = 
-        Blind::Point.new(rand(MINE_FIELD_RANGE), rand(MINE_FIELD_RANGE))
</span><span class="gi">+      @exit_position = random_minefield_position
</span>     end
 
     attr_reader :current_position, :mine_positions, :exit_position
<span class="gu">@@ -42,5 +41,15 @@ def current_region
</span>         :outer_rim
       end
     end
<span class="gi">+
+    private
+    
+    def random_minefield_position
+      begin 
+        point = Blind::Point.new(rand(MINE_FIELD_RANGE), rand(MINE_FIELD_RANGE))
+      end until MINE_FIELD_RANGE.include?(@center.distance(point))
+
+      point
+    end
</span>   end
 end
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Similarly, whenever I wanted to refactor some code to introduce a change or
extend functionality in some way, I needed to write tests to fill the coverage gaps 
that were introduced during my experiment. This lead to a temporary but
sharp rise in the cost of change, and that caused my morale to plummet.</p>

<p>Looking back on what happened, I think the problem was not that I created an
experimental branch with some untested code on it, but that I decided to keep
that code rather than throwing it out and starting fresh. Wiring up my new data
model to the UI and seeing a playable game come out of it was a huge confidence
booster, and it only cost me a couple hours to get to that point. But because I
decided to merge that code into master, I inherited several more hours of
unpredictable maintenance work that might have been avoided if I had redone the
work in a more disciplined way.</p>

<h3 id="sketching-out-an-idea">Sketching out an idea</h3>

<p>About mid-way through my study, I had an idea for a project that I knew I
wouldn’t have time for right away: an abstract interface for describing vector
drawings. However, because I couldn’t stop thinking about the problem, I decided
I needed to make a simple prototype to satisfy my curiosity. An entire evening
of hacking got me to the point where I was able to generate the following image
in PDF format using <a href="https://github.com/prawnpdf/prawn">Prawn</a>:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/OW5gT.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The basic idea of my abstract interface was that rather than making direct calls
to Prawn’s APIs, you could instead describe your diagrams in a general way, such
as in the following example:</p>

</div>

<p>Looking back on this code, I’m still excited by the basic idea, because it
would make it possible for backend-agnostic graphics code to be written, and
would allow for more than a few interesting manipulations of the abstract
structures prior to rendering. However, I can’t help but think that for a
throwaway prototype, there is far too much detail here.</p>

<p>If you take a closer look at <a href="https://gist.github.com/2732815">how I actually implemented Vellum</a>, 
you’ll find that I shoved together 
several classes into a single file, which I stowed away on a gist. I never
bothered to record the history of my experiment, which I assume was actually
built up incrementally rather than designed all at once. Without a single test
to guide me, I would need to study the implementation code all over again if I
wanted to begin to understand what I had actually learned from my experiment.</p>

<p>While it is hard to say whether this little prototype was worth the effort or
not, it underscores a bad habit of mine that bites me from time to time: I can
easily get excited about an idea and then dive into it with reckless abandon. In
this particular situation, I ended up with some working code at the end of
my wild hacking session, but there were several other ideas I worked on during
my study that I ended up getting nowhere with.</p>

<h3 id="what-makes-spiking-different-from-cowboy-coding">What makes spiking different from cowboy coding?</h3>

<p>The main thing I learned from taking a look at how I work on experimental ideas
is that there is a big difference between spiking and cowboy coding.</p>

<p>When you are truly working on a spike, you have a specific question in mind that 
you want to answer, you know roughly how much you’re willing to invest in 
finding out that answer, and you cut as many corners as possible to get that
answer as quickly as possible. The success of a spike is measured by what you
learn, not what code you produce. Once you feel that you understand what
needs to be done, you pull yourself out of spike mode and return to your 
more disciplined way of doing things.</p>

<p>Cowboy coding, on the other hand, is primarily driven by gut feelings, past
experiences, and on-the-spot decision making. This kind of programming can be
fun because it allows you to write code quickly without thinking deeply about
its consequences, but in most circumstances, you end up needing to pay for your
lack of discipline somewhere down the line.</p>

<p>Of the three examples I discussed in this article, the first one looks and feels
like a true spike, and the third one is the result of straight-up guns-blazing
cowboy coding. The second example lies somewhere between those two extremes, and
perhaps represents a spike that turned into a cowboy coding session. I think
scenarios like that are what we really need to look out for, because it is
very easy to drop our good practices but much harder to return to them.</p>

<p>Now that I’ve laid this all out on the line for you, I’d love to hear some
of your own stories! Please leave a comment if you have an interesting
experience to share, or if you have any questions for me.</p>

  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> While doing some research for this article, I stumbled across a nice excerpt
from “The Art of Agile Development” which describes <a href="http://jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/spike_solutions.html">how to safely make use
of spike solutions</a>. It’s
definitely worth checking out if you’re interested in studying this topic more.</p>
