<blockquote>
  <p>If the first thing you type, when writing a Ruby app, is <code class="highlighter-rouge">rails</code>, you’ve
already lost the <a href="http://confreaks.com/videos/759">architecture game</a>.</p>

  <p><cite>Uncle Bob Martin</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first thing we need to ask ourselves when thinking about object persistence
is how we can dehydrate an object into a set of simple values—usually
strings, numbers, dates, and boolean ‘flags’—in a way that will let us
rehydrate it at some point, often on a completely unrelated
run of our application. With the bulk of contemporary Ruby programs being Rails
web apps, this issue is so obvious that we usually don’t even think about it; the
persistence is conveniently taken care of by ActiveRecord, and we often actually
<em>start</em> writing the application by defining database-oriented models of our
objects:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>rails generate model person name bio:text height:float born:date vip:boolean
<span class="gp">$ </span>rake db:migrate
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This simple two-line command sequence takes care of all the behind-the-scenes 
machinery required to persist instances of our <code class="highlighter-rouge">Person</code> class. The main 
problem with the previous example is that it puts us into a tight tunnel
of relational database-driven design. Although many came back saying that the
light at the end is a truly glorious meadow and we should speed up to
get there faster, our actual options of taking detours, driving on the
shoulders, and stopping for a bit to get a high-altitude view of the road ahead
are even more limited than the run of this metaphor. ActiveRecord’s handling of
model relations (<code class="highlighter-rouge">belongs_to</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">has_many</code>, etc.)
sometimes complicates the problem by giving us seemingly all-purpose solutions that
are often quite useful but end up requiring just-this-little-bit-more tweaking, which accumulates over time.</p>

<h3 id="persistence-in-practice">Persistence in practice</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>A database is a black hole into which you put your data. If you’re lucky,
you’ll get it back again. If you’re very lucky, you’ll get it back in a form
you can use.</p>

  <p><cite>Charlie Gibbs</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As mentioned previously, persisting an object means dehydrating it into a set of
simple values. The way we do this depends heavily on the database backend
being used.</p>

<p>When it comes to the most popular case of relational databases (such as MySQL,
PostgreSQL or SQLite), we use tables for classes, rows for objects, and columns
to hold a given object property across all instances of the same class. To
persist an object, we serialize the given object’s properties down into table
cells with column types supported by the underlying database—but even in this
seemingly obvious case, it’s worth it to stop for a second and think.</p>

<p>Should we go for the lowest common denominator (strings, numbers, and dates—
even booleans are not really cross-engine; for instance, MySQL presents them as one-bit
integers, <code class="highlighter-rouge">0</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">1</code>), should we use a given ORM’s ‘common ground’ (here
booleans are usually fair game, and the ORM can take care of exposing them as
<code class="highlighter-rouge">true</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">false</code>), or should we actually limit the portability while
leveraging a given RDBMS’s features? For example, PostgreSQL exposes not only 
‘real’ booleans but also <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/datatype.html">a lot of other very useful
types</a>, including
geometric points and paths, network addresses, and XML documents that
can be searched and filtered via XPath. It even supports arrays, which means
that we can store a given blog post’s tags in a single column in the 
<code class="highlighter-rouge">posts</code> table and query by inclusion/exclusion just as well as we could 
with a separate join table.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Database research has produced a number of good results, but the relational
database is not one of them.</p>

  <p><cite>Henry G. Baker</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Persisting objects in document databases (such as CouchDB or MongoDB) is
somewhat similar, but often also quite a bit different; classes are usually mapped
to collections, objects to documents, and object properties to these documents’
fields. Although strings, numbers, and dates are serialized similarly to relational
databases, document databases also usually allow us to store properties that
are arrays or hashes and allow easy storage of related objects as nested
documents (the canonical example being comments for a blog post, in cases when
they’re most often requested only in the context of the given post). This
results in all sorts of trade-offs. For example, you might end up needing to
do fewer joins overall, but the ones you do have to do come at a higher 
cost in both performance and upfront design work.</p>

<p>Other kinds of databases have still other approaches for serializing objects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Key-value stores (like Redis) usually need the objects to be in an
already serialized form (e.g., represented as JSON strings), but there are
gems like <a href="https://github.com/benlund/roc">ROC</a> that map simple objects
directly to their canonical Redis representations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Graph databases (such as Neo4j) are centered around object relations 
and often allow persisting objects as schema-less nodes, akin to 
document databases.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many other storage types have their own object/persistence 
mapping specifics as well. For example, as a directory service,
LDAP does things in a way that is different from how general-purpose 
persistence methods tend to work.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>From just this short overview, it should be fairly clear that there are no
shortage of options when it comes to deciding how your objects should
be persisted. In fact, even Ruby itself ships with a simple object store!</p>

<h3 id="rubys-built-in-persistence-mechanism">Ruby’s built-in persistence mechanism</h3>

<p>One of my personal favorite ways of persisting objects is the <code class="highlighter-rouge">PStore</code>
library (which is distributed with Ruby) coupled with YAML serialization. Despite being
highly inefficient (compared to powerhouses like relational or document
databases), it’s often more than good enough for small applications, and its
simplicity can be quite a benefit.</p>

<p>Let’s assume for a second that we want to write <a href="https://github.com/chastell/signore">a small application for
handling quotes</a>: what would be the
simplest way to persist them? See for yourself:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'yaml/store'</span>

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Saving the previous example file and running it prints the two quotes just fine:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ ruby quotes.rb

-- Charlie Gibbs

MySQL is truly the PHP of the database world.
-- Will Jessop
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>But a real treat awaits when we inspect the <code class="highlighter-rouge">quotes.yml</code> file:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>---
db:
- !ruby/struct:Quote
  author: Charlie Gibbs
  text: A database is a black hole into which you put your data.
- !ruby/struct:Quote

  text: MySQL is truly the PHP of the database world.
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This approach allows us to have an automated way to persist and rehydrate our <code class="highlighter-rouge">Quote</code>
objects while also allowing us to easily edit them and fix any typos right
there in the YAML file. Is it scalable? Maybe not, but <a href="https://github.com/chastell/dotfiles/blob/aee1d31618e2e4ea88186eda163f29ebd72702d1/.local/share/signore/signatures.yml">my current

consists of 4,000 entries and works fast enough.</p>

<h3 id="sweet-relations-how-do-they-work">Sweet relations: how do they work?</h3>

<p>Now that I’ve covered the idea of object persistence using various backends,
it’s finally time to talk about relations between objects. Quite often the
relations are the crux of our application (even when we’re not building
another social network…), and the problem of their persistence is usually
overlooked and simplified to ‘Let’s just use foreign keys and join tables where
needed.’</p>

<p>The way relations are canonically persisted depends greatly on the type of the
database. Contrary to their name, relational databases are not an ideal
solution for storing relations: their name comes from relations between the
rows of a single table (which translates to the assumption that objects of the
same class have the same property types), not from relations between objects of
potentially different classes, which end up being rows in separate tables.</p>

<p>Modeling relations in relational databases is quite complicated and depends on
the type of relation, its directionality, and whether it carries any
relation-specific data. For example, an object representing a person can have
the relations such as having a particular gender (one-to-many relation), having
a hobby (many-to-many), having a spouse (many-to-many, with the relation
carrying additional data, such as start date of the relationship),
participating in an event (many-to-many, with additional data such as
participation role), being on two different ends of a parental relation (having
parents and children), and so on. Some of these relations (gender) can be stored
right in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">people</code> table; some need to be represented by having a foreign
key; others require a separate join table (potentially carrying any
relation-specific data). Dereferencing such relations means crafting and
executing (potentially complicated) SQL <code class="highlighter-rouge">JOIN</code> queries.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/CO6gf.png" alt="relations" /></p>

<p><em>An example set of relations (arrows) between ‘typical’ objects in a system.</em></p>

<p>Modeling relations in document databases is quite different from modeling for
a RDMS. Some of the relations (like the above-mentioned post/comments example) 
are best modeled using embedded documents. Despite being very useful in certain scenarios (e.g., retrieving
a post with all of its comments), this approach might cause problems when new
features require cross-cutting through all of such embedded documents. For
example, retrieving all of the comments by a given person or getting the list of the
most recent comments means scanning through the whole <code class="highlighter-rouge">posts</code> collection.</p>

<p>Although some document databases employ implicit, foreign-key-like references
(e.g., MongoDB’s DBRefs, which are two-key documents of the form `{ $ref:</p>
<collection>, $id: <object_id> }`), dereferencing relations is usually a bigger
problem (due to the lack of standard approaches like SQL `JOIN` queries) and is
often done on the client side, even if it’s greatly simplified by tools like
[MongoHydrator](https://github.com/gregspurrier/mongo_hydrator).

Key-value stores are, by definition, the least relation-friendly backends—and
using them for modeling relations requires explicit foreign keys that need to
be managed on the client side. On the other end of the spectrum are graph databases:
relations (modeled as edges) can usually carry any data required, can as
easily point in either or both directions, and are represented in the same way
regardless of whether they model a one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many
relation. Graph databases also allow for all kinds of data analysis/querying
based on the relations themselves, making things like graph traversal or proximity
metrics easier and faster than they would be with a relational database.

### Modeling relations as proper objects

Now that you know the different ways (and issues with) persisting objects and
relations between them, is there a way to model relations that could be deemed
‘persistence independent’, or at least ‘not persistence driven’? One such approach 
would be to model relations as proper objects in the system, akin to
how they’re modeled in graph databases.

In this approach, relations would be objects that reference two other objects
and carry any additional data particular to a given relation (such as
participation role in a relation between a person and an event, start/end dates
of the given relation, etc.). This approach is the most flexible in schema-less
databases—document databases could have a separate collection of relations,
and different relations could store different types of data. In relational
databases, this design could be modeled by either separate tables (one per relation
type) or a common `relations` table storing the references to the related
objects and a relation type pointing to a table holding data for all relations
of this particular type/schema.

The main drawback of this approach is dereferencing—getting other objects
related to the object at hand would be a two-step process: getting all of
the object’s relations (potentially only of a certain type) and then getting
all of the ‘other’ objects referenced by these relations. Note, however, that
this is exactly what we do every day with join tables for many-to-many
relations, so the drawback is mostly that this approach would apply to all of
the relations in the given system, not only many-to-many ones.

The main advantages of this approach are its simplicity (everything is an
object; relations just happen to carry certain properties, like the identifiers
of the objects they reference) and its potential higher portability (in that it doesn't tie
the way relations are modeled to a given persistence approach). Having
relations as proper objects can also help in producing aggregated statistics
about the system (like ‘what are the hubs of the system—the most connected
objects, regardless of relation type’).

Additionally, when all of the objects in the system have unique identifiers
(_of course_ [PostgreSQL has a native type for
UUIDs](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/datatype-uuid.html)),
relations no longer need to carry the information about the table/collection of
the referenced object; assuming the system has a way to retrieve an object
solely based on its UUID, relations become—in their simplest form—just
triples of 128-bit UUIDs (one identifying the relation and the other two identifying the
referenced objects) plus some information about the relation type.

### Object databases

&gt; Now that people are considering NoSQL, will more people consider no-database?
&gt;
&gt; <cite>Martin Fowler</cite>

A different approach to solving problems with persisting relations
between objects is to persist the objects not in a way that requires explicit
mapping, but by using an object database.

In the past, there were a few approaches to solving this problem in Ruby—
notable contestants being [Madeleine](http://madeleine.rubyforge.org),
[ODB](http://zeropluszero.com/software/odb/), and
[HybridDB](https://github.com/pauliephonic/hybriddb); unfortunately, all of
these seem to be no longer maintained (although some birds at the wroc\_love.rb
conference earlier this year suggested that it might be revived if enough interest
is expressed!). Currently the most promising solution for straight object
persistence is [MagLev](http://maglev.github.com), a recently released Ruby
implementation built on top of the GemStone/S Virtual Machine known as _the_
Smalltalk object persistence solution. Although it probably won’t be
a widely adopted silver bullet for some time, I have high hopes for MagLev and
the changes that object persistence can bring to the way we think about giving our
objects immortality.

Unfortunately, because the use of object databases is not widespread at all,
there is not much more to say about them except that they may prove to be an
interesting option in the future.

### Not your usual persistence models

I will wrap up this article with two examples of object persistence
that are not related to persisting relations but rather to hiding persistence
altogether. ActiveRecord gives us a nice abstraction for wrting SQL, but
these two examples show how persistence can be abstracted even more.

The first example is [Candy](https://github.com/SFEley/candy). Although it is
currently unmaintained and in need of a fix to get running with the current
mongo gem, Candy is a nice and/or crazy example of how object persistence can be hidden
from our eyes with a single `include Candy::Piece` line:

```ruby
require 'candy'

class Conference
  include Candy::Piece
end

rubyconf = Conference.new
# connects to localhost:27017 and 'chastell' db if needed
# and saves a new document to the 'Conference' collection

rubyconf.location = 'New Orleans'   # method_missing resaves

rubyconf.events = { parties: { thursday: '&amp;block Party' } }
rubyconf.events.parties.thursday    #=&gt; '&amp;block Party'
```

For a similarly unobtrusive way to _query_ a collection,
[Ambition](https://github.com/defunkt/ambition) provides a way 
to do Ruby-like queries against any supported persistence store. 
Like Candy, it is currently unmaintained but still worth checking out.

To see why Ambition is interesting, compare the following query against 
an ActiveRecord-supported store:

```ruby
require 'ambition/adapters/active_record'

class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
end

Person.select do |p|
  (p.country == 'USA' &amp;&amp; p.age &gt;= 21) ||
  (p.country != 'USA' &amp;&amp; p.age &gt;= 18)
end
```

with an example query against an LDAP backend:

```ruby
require 'ambition/adapters/active_ldap'

class Person &lt; ActiveLdap::Base
end

Person.select do |p|
  (p.country == 'USA' &amp;&amp; p.age &gt;= 21) ||
  (p.country != 'USA' &amp;&amp; p.age &gt;= 18)
end
```

Although the code difference lays solely in the `require` and inheritance
clauses, the resulting backend query in the first place is the following SQL:

```sql
SELECT * FROM people
WHERE (
  (people.country =  'USA' AND people.age &gt;= 21) OR
  (people.country &lt;&gt; 'USA' AND people.age &gt;= 18)
)
```

And the query generated by the latter is the equivalent LDAP selector:

```
(|
  (&amp; (country=USA)    (age&gt;=21))
  (&amp; (!(country=USA)) (age&gt;=18))
)
```

These examples demonstrate how the benefits of the cross-platform nature of
using an ORM are preserved even though the syntax makes it appear as if
you are not working with a database at all. Although this style of interface
never quite caught on in the Ruby world, it is at least interesting to
think about.

### Closing thoughts

The problem of persisting object relations is tightly related to the general problem of object
persistence. Rails, with its `rails generate model`–driven development,
teaches us that our domain models should be tied one-to-one to their database
representations, but there are other (potentially better) ways to do persistence
in the object-oriented world.

If this topic sounds intriguing, you might be

highly revised version scheduled for the Scottish Ruby Conference in Edinburgh):
