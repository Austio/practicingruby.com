<p>This project was started by <a href="https://practicingdeveloper.com">Gregory Brown</a> in 2010, and is meant to help software developers everywhere broaden their horizons and see their work in a new light.</p><p>Although it went on (unplanned) hiatus for a couple years while while Gregory wrestled with "the rest of life" ... a renewed effort began in October 2017 to bring the project back to life.
