If you enjoy Practicing Ruby and want to support my work, please sign up
for the free <a href="http://tinyletter.com/programming-beyond-practices">Programming Beyond Practices newsletter</a>.</p>

<p>
I am currently working on a book for O'Reilly by the same name, and its newsletter
is where I've been sharing ideas, notes, and sample chapters.
If you like what I'm posting there, please forward the emails along to others,
and buy the book when it's ready for purchase.
</p>

<p>
I plan to use my royalties from this book to fund my own time working on Practicing Ruby,
with the goal of doing a dozen collaborations with thoughtful Ruby community
members in the near future. I spend anywhere from 5-10 work days on each collaboration,
so this is a very labor-intensive process for me.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/828998531/practicing-ruby-contributors-fund">Kickstarter campaign</a> we ran in June 2015, funding has already been secured to pay a $500 honorarium to
each collaborator that contributes to Practicing Ruby.
</p>

<p>
Practicing Ruby is independent, open access, and will never run advertisements.
Support from readers like you make this possible!
